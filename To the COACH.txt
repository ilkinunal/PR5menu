Hi,
i finally manage to make the links working:
http://pr5menu.appspot.com/ 

but now comments section is not working! 
if you click to Comments section at the buttom, you will see the mess under Submitted Comments :

Submitted Comments
{% if usercomments %} {% for usercomment in usercomments %}
{% if usercomment.user %} {{usercomment.user}} wrote: {% else %} Anonymous User wrote: {% endif %}
{{usercomment.comment}}
{% endfor %} {% else %} 
There are no comments. {% endif %}

also, it does not store data anymore. i couldn't figure out why ..
Could you please help ?
cheers,
ilkin
